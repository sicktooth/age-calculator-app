# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app

![Design preview for the Age calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

The Age calculator app was a good challenge for testing form validation, javascript and working with dates of which gave me a tough time to figure out.

The first problem that I faced was after user inputs, the form should not be submitted of which I accomplished with the ```e.preventDefault()``` method.

The second problem that I encountered was adding animations to the page after data has been calculated but with the help of a youtube video I learnt how to do that with the ```updateDisplay()``` function:

```js
function updateDisplay(){
        const counters = document.querySelectorAll(".counter");
        counters.forEach(function (counter) {
            let initial_count = -1;
            const final_count = counter.dataset.count;

            const counting = setInterval(updateCounting, 40);

            function updateCounting(){
                initial_count++;
                
                counter.innerText = initial_count; 
                
                if (initial_count == final_count) {
                    clearInterval(counting);
                }
            }
        });
    }
```

### Continued development

I want to continue sharpening my JS skills and including accessibility best practices. I'm also really interested in growing my animation skills.

### Useful resources

- [CodingDesign Number Counting Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfDIU93fN3o) - This helped me in achieving the animation.
